A temporary workaround for
[MDL-50697](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-50697) that may develop into a
more permanent solution.

## Usage

1. Pop the renderer class into your theme somewhere.
2. ind include it from your theme's renderers.php``` file.
3. Rename the class appropriately for the name of your theme.
